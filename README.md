**Video for Vk (or VT) is client for Vk video API.** 

[Google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=akhmedoff.usman.videoforvk)

Here I implement, as far as possible, the full functionality of the video directory Vk.

I use in the application:

 - Android architecture components (LiveData, ViewModel)
 - Retrofit
 - OkHttp
 - Gson
 - Video realized with ExoPlayer
 - Firebase
 - Picasso
 - MVP
